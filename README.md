# Caesar Cipher

This app provides a minimal UI for creating [Caesar Ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) with the option to set the shift amount and direction. It makes the assumption to currently not support characters with diacritic marks. The look and feel is intentionally fairly barebones and minimal at this stage.
